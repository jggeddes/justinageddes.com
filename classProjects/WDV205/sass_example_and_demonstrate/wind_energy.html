<h3>Fast Facts</h3>

	<li>Big in size</li>
	<li>Usually seen in big fields </li>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Wind energy is a <em>modern day way to use wind as a form of electricity.</em> <strong><em>Wind turbines are used to collect the energy from the wind to make it into electricity to power our homes, factories, etc.</em></strong></p>

<h3>What are Wind Turbines and how do they produce energy?</h3>
<p>Wind turbines are usually placed in a big area with plenty of space for there big propeller-like blades to rotate without hitting another turbine. These fields of turbines can be seen from the road and there might be 10+ in any given filed depending on the area they are in.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>These turbines can be any size but the most typical size is 130-300ft tall but can get as tall as 850ft. The blade on a turbine depend on the size of turbine you need but can be around 150ft per blade.</p>

<h3>Additional Information</h3>
<p>Wind energy is cost-effective. Not only are they cost effective but they also create jobs. <strong>Turbines have some negative affects as well as positive ones.</strong> &ldquo;Those big blades on turbines kill lots of birds, bats, etc.&rdquo; </q> It is less than cell and radio towers though.</p>
