<h3>WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE PRICE?</h3>

	<li>All meals and snacks except one dinner on your own</li>

</ul>

<h3>WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED?</h3>
<p>Typical trip exclusions are detailed for you in our pre-trip planners, and they include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gratuities to Austin Adventures guides</li>
	<li>Alcoholic beverages and related gratuities</li>
	<li>1 dinner during the trip</li>
	<li>Pre-and post-trip accommodations and associated expenses</li>

	<li>Personal travel and medical insurance</li>
	<li>Optional activities and spa services</li>
	<li>Items of a personal nature </li>
</ul>
<h3>HOW DIFFICULT AND FLEXIBLE ARE TRIP ACTIVITIES?</h3>
<p>You don't have to be a fitness fanatic to enjoy our trips. A typical day consists of a personally paced 5-mile hike or 20-mile bike ride. We're flexible, though we'll adjust distances and levels of difficulty up or down according to your abilities and desires.</p>

<h3>HOW LARGE ARE YOUR GROUPS?</h3>
<p>We promise an intimate experience with maximum flexibility and personal attention. On most trips, we take 2 guides and an average of 10 to 12 guests. On family adventures we can accommodate up to 18 guests with 3 guides. We are also experts at planning exclusive and custom trips ranging from 5 guests to 50 or more.</p>

<h3>WHAT ABOUT SINGLE AND SOLO TRAVELERS?</h3>
<p>Many of our guests travel solo. Solo travelers have the option of paying a single supplement for a private room throughout the trip. At your request, we will also try to match you up with a suitable roommate. If we're unable to do so and you are forced into a private room situation, we will only charge you 50% of the customary single supplement charge (on most trips). We recommend talking to one of our Custom Trip Experts if this is something you're interested in.</p>

<h3>WILL I HAVE TIME TO SPEND ON MY OWN?</h3>
<p>Though our days are busy, there's always downtime to shop, relax or visit the spa. At any time during your trip, if you feel like putting your feet up instead of opting for the day's activities, that's fine. This is your vacation!</p>

<h3>CAN I TALK TO SOMEONE WHO's TAKEN A TRIP WITH YOU?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! Our alumni are some of our best sources of information. Just give us a call and we'll provide references for the specific trip you're interested in.</p>

<h3>HOW FAR IN ADVANCE DO I NEED TO RESERVE MY TRIP?</h3>
<p>The farther in advance you book, the better selection of dates you'll have. On most trips you'll want to book 3 to 6 months out. For holiday trips, you'll want to reserve 6 to 8 months out. Rest assured, though, we're also masters at accommodating last-minute reservations!</p>

<h3>WHAT MIGHT I NEED TO BRING?</h3>

<p>Here is a list of items that we think would be important to bring from home or buy ahead of time. We have even offered online sites to help you order the stuff you may need.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.moosejaw.com/search/backpacks" target="_blank"> Hiking Bag</a></li>
