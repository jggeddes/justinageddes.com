<p style="color:red;">Chocolate started in the <em>Mexico and Guatemala region</em>. We have beverages that were made from chocolate that date back from <strong>450 B.C.</strong> Chocolate as we know it today wasn't your average candy bar it was a drink. Back then chocolate was used as a drink. Even though chocolate is still used as a drink today we can find it in a candy store in the form of a candy bar.</p>

<p>Cocoa trees grow in Mesoamerica. These trees are where we get our chocolate from. The tree produces these beans in what is called a sheath. The bean may have been fermented and to be used in an alcoholic beverage back then.</p>
